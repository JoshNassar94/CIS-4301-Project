1.) Percentage of students playing each sport (not exact query specified)

select sporttype, count(*)/(select count(*) from IntramuralTeamRoster inner join
 UfAffiliate on IntramuralTeamRoster.UfAffiliate  = UfAffiliate.ufid) Percentage 
from (select * from IntramuralTeamRoster inner join UfAffiliate on 
IntramuralTeamRoster.UfAffiliate  = UfAffiliate.ufid) x join IntramuralTeam on IntramuralTeam.TeamID = x.TeamID group by sporttype;

2.) getting number of checkouts per day

for some reason I can't divide these two in a single query

//number of checkin
select count(*) from equipmenttransaction where transactiontype = 'I';

//number of unique check in days
select count(*) from (select transactiondate from equipmenttransaction where transactiontype = 'I' group by transactiondate);

3.) amount of times each time has won

select t, (count(*) + (select count(*) from intramuralgame where team2id = t and team1score < team2score)) win1 
from (select distinct teamid t from intramuralteam join intramuralgame on teamid = team1id or teamid = team2id), 
intramuralgame where team1id = t and team1score > team2score group by t;
